    "bio": "Programming is like fine art â€“ it takes time, practice and dedication to produce beautiful code. As a programmer with a background in music and art, I understand the challenge of articulating complex ideas in a team setting with collaborators. This pain point is my motivation for writing clean, dry, concise code that makes people shed a tear (in a good way). I am a quick learner who is highly adaptive and able to work in stressful situations, whether in a team setting or in a remote, autonomous setting. I hope to gain experience in the workplace that will allow me to showcase my communication skills and further expand my development knowledge.",
